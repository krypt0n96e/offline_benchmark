## Notes

This README is based on the project's integration of two main Espressif components: the ESP-TFLite-Micro framework for TensorFlow Lite inference and the ESP-NN library for hardware-accelerated neural network operations. The project appears to focus on offline benchmarking rather than real-time inference, making it suitable for performance evaluation and optimization testing on ESP32 platforms.
